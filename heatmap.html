    <p>This example showcases simple usage of <strong>HeatmapScrollingGridSeries </strong>, a simple, yet incredibly
        powerful series type.</p>
    <p><strong>HeatmapScrollingGridSeries</strong> visualizes three dimensional data (X, Y, color) of large quantities.
        It can easily handle data sets in million data points range even on low-end devices.
        With large amounts of RAM even <strong> billions </strong> of data points can be visualized!</p>
    <p>The example displays live speed of incoming data as data points per second, feel free to try higher data rates by
        altering <strong> dataSample </strong> Size in the example code to see how much data
        <strong>HeatmapScrollingGridSeries</strong> can handle on your machine!</p>
    <p>For reference, on a Lenovo Yoga (average office laptop with no GPU to speak of), there was no visible effort even
        with dataSampleSize: 5000 which means 150 000 incoming data points every single second.</p>
    <p>What&#39;s equally impressive is that thanks to automatic data cleaning, this application can run indefinitely!
